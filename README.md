## Description of the project


In this project, I have developed a simple online store using the Django framework. Through the admin panel, it is possible to automatically add new products and categories. On the website itself, you can sort products by categories, as well as use the search feature to find products by name and description. When a customer places an order, their information is displayed in the admin panel. Additionally, various small details have been implemented in the project, such as informing users if a category has no products available.
